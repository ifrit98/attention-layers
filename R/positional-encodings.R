#' Gets a timing signal for a given length and number of channels
#' 
#' Gets a bunch of sinusoids of different frequencies.
#' Each channel of the input Tensor is incremented by a sinusoid of a different
#' frequency and phase.
#' This allows attention to learn to use absolute and relative positions.
#' Timing signals should be added to some precursors of both the query and the
#' memory inputs to attention.
#' The use of relative position is possible because sin(x+y) and cos(x+y) can 
#' be expressed in terms of y, sin(x) and cos(x).
#' In particular, we use a geometric sequence of timescales starting with
#' min_timescale and ending with max_timescale.  The number of different
#' timescales is equal to channels / 2. For each timescale, we
#' generate the two sinusoidal signals sin(timestep/timescale) and
#' cos(timestep/timescale).  All of these sinusoids are concatenated in
#' the channels dimension.
#' 
#' @param length scalar, length of timing signal sequence.
#' @param channels scalar, size of timing embeddings to create. 
#' The number of different timescales is equal to channels / 2.
#' @param min_timescale: a float
